### C5. Commit the File

1. Scroll down to the **Commit changes** section
2. You'll see:
   - **Commit message:** Leave as "Create deploy.yml" or type your own
   - **Description:** (optional) You can leave this empty
   - **Commit directly to the `main` branch** should be selected
3. Click the green **Commit changes** button

---

### C6. Verify the File Was Created

After committing, you should see:
- A new folder `.github` in your repository
- Inside it: `workflows` folder
- Inside that: `deploy.yml` file

Your repo structure now looks like:
```
heuristic-evaluator/
├── .github/
│   └── workflows/
│       └── deploy.yml    ← New file
├── src/
│   ├── App.jsx
│   ├── main.jsx
│   └── index.css
├── .gitignore
├── README.md
├── index.html
├── package.json
├── postcss.config.js
├── tailwind.config.js
└── vite.config.js
```

---

### C7. Watch the Workflow Run

1. Click the **Actions** tab at the top of your repository
2. You'll see a workflow running called "Deploy to GitHub Pages"
3. Click on it to see the progress
4. Wait for all steps to show ✅ green checkmarks (takes 1-2 minutes)

**If you see a ❌ red X:** Click on it to see the error message and let me know what it says.

---

### C8. Troubleshooting

**"Pages not enabled" error?**
→ Continue to Step D (Enable GitHub Pages) first, then re-run the workflow

**"npm ci" failed?**
→ Make sure `package.json` was uploaded correctly with all dependencies

**Workflow doesn't appear?**
→ Make sure the file is named exactly `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`

---

## Next: Step D - Enable GitHub Pages

After the workflow file is created:

1. Click **Settings** tab (top right of repo)
2. Scroll down left sidebar → Click **Pages**
3. Under "Build and deployment":
   - **Source:** Select **GitHub Actions** (not "Deploy from a branch")
4. Click **Save**
5. Go back to **Actions** tab
6. If the workflow failed before, click **Re-run all jobs**

---

## Step E: Get Your Live URL

Once the workflow shows ✅ success:

1. Go to **Settings** → **Pages**
2. You'll see a green box with your URL:
```
   Your site is live at https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/heuristic-evaluator/
